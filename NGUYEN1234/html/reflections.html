	<p>The CIS 241 - WEB DEVELOPMENT I course was for me a good experience. I had been writing with HTML5 and CSS for a while and this course help me to improve and reinforce my knowledge.
	<br> I am excited to continue to the next course and see what I will learn in the next quarter.
	<br> My "Ah ha!" moment was during the conception of the website, I was looking for hours why my website did not change after modifying my CSS stylesheet. I refreshed the page a hundreds times, rewrote the code many times, spend hours looking everywhere until I realized that was a miss-spelling of a class because class are case-sensitive.
	<br> I took 3 advil after fixing the issue &#129299;.
