      <p> Welcome to my website !
        <br>
        <br>My name is Antoine, but people call me... Antoine &#128513;.
        <br> I am from France. I moved to USA three years ago. I currently live in Everett,WA.
        <br>I don't know what to say about myself. I just take life as it comes. From now, I'm very happy with what I'm doing.
        <br>I am the middle one on my familly, two big brothers, one little sister and one little brother. I also have a mom and a dad (which is logical) I love them and I miss them all.
      </p>

      <p> Moving to another country was the biggest change in my life. It is something that will change your lifetime forever.
        <br> It is an amazing experience to move to another country to discover the culture, food and people.
        <br> And also it is good thing to do if you want to practice the language.
      </p>

      <p> I consider myself as a big nerd/geek or whatever you call that &#128513;. I love movies, music, technology, video games, hiking, hang out with friends/family.
      </p>

      <p> Have fun and stay safe !
